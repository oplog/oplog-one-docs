# Errors

> In the events of API request errors, oplog.one uses conventional HTTP response codes in the 4XX and 5XX range to indicate the reason behind the error.

Oplog.one uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a duplicate reference ID already exists, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with oplog.one's servers.

## HTTP Status Codes

| HTTP Status Code | Status                 | Description                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 200 or 201       | OK                     | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
| 400              | Bad Request            | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                        |
| 401              | Unauthorized           | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
| 403              | Forbidden              | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.                                     |
| 404              | Not Found              | The requested resource doesn't exist.                                                            |
| 422              | Duplicate reference ID | You have already created a product or order with the same `reference_id`                        |
| 429              | Too Many Requests      | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.|
| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors       | Something went wrong on oplog.one's end.                                                        |

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, oplog.one returns a JSON response with error details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_PARAMETER",
    "message": "The 'sku' parameter is required",
    "details": {
      "field": "sku",
      "value": null
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-06-24T10:30:00Z",
  "request_id": "req_1234567890"
