---

> In the events of API request errors, OPLOG.ONE uses conventional HTTP response codes in the 4XX and 5XX range to indicate the reason behind the error.

OPLOG.ONE uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a duplicate reference number already exists, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with OPLOG.ONE's servers.

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| **2xx Success** | |
| 200 OK | Request succeeded |
| 201 Created | Resource successfully created |
| **4xx Client Error** | |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request format or parameters |
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key or authentication |
| 404 Not Found | Resource not found |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| **5xx Server Error** | |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Something went wrong on OPLOG.ONE's end |
| 502 Bad Gateway | Temporary server issue |
| 503 Service Unavailable | Service temporarily unavailable |

    "message": "Validation Errors",
    "errors": [
      {
        "property": "AddressOneMaxLength",
        "message": "AddressOneMaxLength",
        "errorCode": "AddressOneMaxLength"
      }
