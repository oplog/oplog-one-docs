---

OPLOG.ONE uses OAuth 2.0 authentication to secure API requests. All API calls must include proper authentication headers to access the system.

## Authentication Method

OPLOG.ONE verifies API requests using OAuth 2.0 tokens in the request headers. This secure authentication method ensures that only authorized applications can access your data.

## Getting Your API Credentials

To authenticate with the OPLOG.ONE API, you need two essential credentials:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Integration Settings">
    Navigate to **Integrations** > **OpenAPI** in your OPLOG.ONE dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Integration Setup">
    Follow the integration setup process to configure your API access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain Credentials">
    After setup completion, you will receive:
    - **X-Tenant-Id**: Your unique tenant identifier
    - **StaticToken**: Your authorization token
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Copy and securely store both credentials - you'll need them for all API requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Keep your StaticToken secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Required Headers

Include these headers in every API request:

```http
X-Tenant-Id: your-tenant-id
Authorization: Bearer your-static-token
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Account Setup

If you don't have an OPLOG.ONE account yet, contact our support team at [onboarding@oplog.io](mailto:onboarding@oplog.io) to create a staging account for testing and development.

<Info>
  All API endpoints require proper authentication. Requests without valid credentials will return a 401 Unauthorized error.
