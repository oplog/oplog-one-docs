# Quickstart

This quickstart guide intends to walk you through a few common scenarios to let you understand how to use the oplog.one API.

## 1. Get API key

Oplog.one verifies a user's request by using a Bearer token in the header. We call this a Personal Access Token.

On the oplog.one dashboard, go to **Settings** > **API Tokens**. Click Generate New Token. Copy this token as we will use in next step. If you do not have an oplog.one account yet, you can create a sandbox account by contacting our support team.

## 2. Make your first API request

Use your PAT token to make a request to the [GET Channels](http://localhost:7701/api/v1/channels) endpoint. You will need the channel ID to create cargo carriers, customers and products with the oplog.one API.

```
GET http://localhost:7701/api/v1/channels
```

<Tip>
  If you are using an oplog.one sandbox account, make sure to update your endpoint to the sandbox URL provided by our team.

<Accordion title="Example response">
  The channel ID to use when creating cargo carriers, customers and products would be `100102` since this is the channel that has the required permissions.

  ```json GET Channel /api/v1/channels {3-24}
  [
    {
        "id": 100102,
        "name": "Logistics Access Token",
        "application_name": "OPLOG",
        "scopes": [

        ]
    },
