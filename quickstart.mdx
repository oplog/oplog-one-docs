description: 'Get started with OPLOG.ONE API in minutes'
---

This quickstart guide intends to walk you through a few common scenarios to let you understand how to use the OPLOG.ONE API.

## 1. Get API key

Oplog.one verifies a user's request by using a Auth2.0 token in the header. We call this method.

On the Oplog.one dashboard, go to **Integrations** > **OpenAPI** to set up the integration. Once the integration is complete, you will be provided with an **X-Tenant-Id** and a **StaticToken** for Authorization. Copy and securely store this information, as we will use it in the next step. If you do not have an Oplog.one account yet, you can contact our support team to create a staging account.

## 2. Common scenarios
