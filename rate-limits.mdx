---

API calls will be rate-limited to **250 requests per minute** using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the OPLOG.ONE APIs.

Please give us time to process your requests. If you're sending too many requests too quickly, we'll respond with a **429 error code** (TooManyRequests).

## Rate Limit Headers

The API response headers also give you the following rate limit detailed information:

| Header              | Example | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-retry-after`     | 25      | Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 25 seconds.  |
| `x-remaining-calls` | 0       | You have 0 remaining calls.                       |

## Rate Limit Response

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 status code with the following response:

```json
{
    "statusCode": 429,
    "message": "Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 25 seconds."
}
```

  <Card title="Implement Retry Logic" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Use the `x-retry-after` header to implement proper retry delays
