---

OPLOG's [Returns API](../api-reference/returns) provides comprehensive return management capabilities for tracking and processing product returns. This guide covers the essential requirements, query methods, and examples for managing different types of return scenarios.

## Integration Overview

The Returns API is designed to handle the complete return lifecycle:
- **Return Tracking** - Query return status and processing stages
- **Warehouse Integration** - Real-time updates when packages arrive
- **State Management** - Track returns from creation to completion
- **Reference Matching** - Connect returns to original sales orders

<Info>
All return operations use GET endpoints since the return process begins when packages physically arrive at the warehouse. The system tracks real-world return events and provides query capabilities for status monitoring.
</Info>

## Return Process Flow

<Note>
**Important Note: Return Endpoint Usage**

In the OPLOG system, in real life, the return process begins when the package physically arrives at the warehouse. Therefore, the GET endpoint should be used for return operations.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="ReturnCreated (Return Created)">
    - Warehouse staff requested a return
    - `arrivedToWarehouseAt` and `completedAt` fields are null
  </Step>
  <Step title="ArrivedToWarehouse (Arrived at Warehouse)">
    - Package arrived at warehouse
    - Warehouse staff processed package entry
    - `arrivedToWarehouseAt` field was populated
    - Return processing started
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed (Completed)">
    - Return process completed
    - Product was inspected and restocked/disposed
    - `completedAt` field was populated
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Return States

The return process follows these states:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="ReturnCreated" icon="plus">
    Return record created in the system
  </Card>
  <Card title="ArrivedToWarehouse" icon="warehouse">
    Package arrived at warehouse facility
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completed" icon="check">
    Return process completed successfully
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Query Methods

<Warning>
  For querying actual return statuses, always use the GET endpoint as returns are processed based on physical package arrivals.
</Warning>

### Basic Return Query

## TAG Management

OPLOG.ONE's TAG management system provides flexible metadata tagging capabilities across various business entities. Organizations can attach custom labels to records, transforming basic data into actionable intelligence for better workflow optimization.

The system proves valuable for both operational efficiency and analytics. Teams can quickly identify and process records based on specific criteria - staff can locate items requiring special handling, managers can prioritize high-value transactions, and leadership can analyze performance metrics across different categories. This flexible approach eliminates rigid classification systems, allowing businesses to evolve their tagging strategies as operational needs change.

### TAG Best Practices for Returns

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Return Reason" icon="question-circle">
    Tag by reason: `defective`, `wrong-size`, `customer-change`, `damaged`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Processing Priority" icon="flag">
    Mark urgency: `urgent-refund`, `priority-return`, `standard`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Category" icon="box">
    Categorize items: `electronics`, `apparel`, `fragile`, `bulk-return`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Action Required" icon="tasks">
    Next steps: `refund-pending`, `exchange-requested`, `investigate`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**TAG Usage Examples:**
- **Reason Tags**: `defective-product,wrong-size,customer-dissatisfaction,damaged-shipping`
- **Priority Tags**: `urgent-refund,priority-return,vip-customer,high-value`
- **Category Tags**: `electronics,apparel,cosmetics,books,fragile-item`
- **Process Tags**: `quality-check-required,refund-approved,exchange-pending`
- **Analysis Tags**: `frequent-returner,seasonal-return,promotion-related`

<Info>
TAG management for returns enables detailed return analysis, automated workflows, and improved customer service through categorized processing.
