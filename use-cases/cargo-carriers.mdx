OPLOG's [Cargo Carriers API](../api-reference/cargo-carriers) provides comprehensive management capabilities for cargo and shipping companies integrated with the platform. This guide covers the essential requirements, query methods, and examples for working with cargo carrier data.

## Integration Overview

The Cargo Carriers API is designed to handle shipping partner management:
- **Carrier Information** - Access shipping company details and capabilities
- **Dynamic Updates** - Real-time carrier availability and service updates
- **Reference Management** - Consistent carrier identification across systems
- **Service Integration** - Connect with various shipping and logistics providers

<Info>
All cargo carrier operations use GET endpoints to retrieve current carrier information. The system maintains up-to-date carrier data and provides query capabilities for integration purposes.
