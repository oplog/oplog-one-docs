# Receiving Orders

OPLOG's [Receiving Order API](../api-reference/receiving-orders) enables you to initiate the receiving process for products to be sent to the warehouse. This guide covers the essential requirements, configurations, and examples for creating different types of receiving orders.

## Integration Overview

The Receiving Order API is designed to handle multiple transfer methods:
- **Cargo Transfer** - Shipment via cargo companies (FedEx, UPS, DHL)
- **Pickup Transfer** - Pickup from your warehouse or location
- **Carriage Transfer** - Courier delivery services
- **Multi-Product Shipments** - Bulk receiving orders with multiple SKUs

<Info>
All receiving orders must include unique reference numbers, line items with SKUs and expected quantities, and transfer type configuration. Products must be pre-registered in the system using the Product API.
</Info>

## Creating Receiving Orders

OPLOG's [Receiving Order POST endpoint](../api-reference/receiving-orders#create-receiving-order) has several required fields that you need to be aware of:
