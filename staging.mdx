title: 'Staging Environment'
description: 'Test your OPLOG.ONE integration safely with our staging environment before going live'
---

The OPLOG.ONE staging environment provides a safe testing space where you can develop and test your integration with realistic, production-like data without affecting live operations.

## What is the Staging Environment?

The staging environment allows you to:

- **Test your integration** with realistic, production-like data
- **Validate API functionality** before implementing in production
- **Identify and resolve issues** before they affect real shipments
- **Practice workflows** for products, orders, and inventory management

Think of it as a rehearsalâ€”everything works like the real system, but no actual shipments are made.

<Note>
  If you haven't created a Staging account yet, contact our support team at [onboarding@oplog.io](mailto:onboarding@oplog.io) to set up your staging environment.
</Note>

## Setting Up Your Staging Environment

### Step 1: Create Your Staging Account

Contact our support team to create a staging account that mirrors your production setup:

- Dedicated staging tenant with separate credentials
- Test data environment with sample products and inventory
- Access to all API endpoints in a safe testing environment

### Step 2: Configure API Access

Once your staging account is ready:

1. **Access Dashboard**: Log into your staging dashboard at `https://staging.oplog.one`
2. **Navigate to Integration**: Go to **Integrations** > **OpenAPI**
3. **Complete Setup**: Follow the integration setup process
4. **Obtain Credentials**: You'll receive staging-specific credentials:
   - **X-Tenant-Id**: Your staging tenant identifier
   - **StaticToken**: Your staging authorization token

<Warning>
  Store your staging credentials separately from production. Never use production credentials in staging or vice versa.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Update Base URL

Use the staging base URL for all API requests:

```
https://one-webapi-stg-01-dac9drerbbc8dtd3.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net
```

## Testing Your Integration

### Available Test Scenarios

You can test the following operations in staging:

  <Card title="Product Management" icon="box">
    Create and manage product definitions with test SKUs and inventory
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sales Orders" icon="shopping-cart">
    Process test orders with various payment methods and shipping options
  </Card>
  <Card title="Receiving Orders" icon="truck">
    Test incoming inventory workflows with different transfer types
  </Card>
  <Card title="Returns Processing" icon="undo">
    Validate return workflows and status transitions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Testing Workflow

1. **Send API Requests**: Use staging endpoints to test your integration
2. **Check Response Codes**: 
   - `2xx` status codes indicate successful requests
   - `4xx` status codes indicate client errors - refer to our [Error Reference](/errors)
3. **Monitor Status Changes**: Track order status transitions and workflow progression
4. **Validate Data**: Ensure your integration handles responses correctly

### Working with Test Data

#### Product Definitions
- Create test products with unique SKUs
- Verify product data requirements and validation rules
- Test inventory management workflows

#### Order Processing
- Send test orders with various configurations
- Validate order status transitions
- Test different payment methods and shipping options

#### Inventory Operations
- Test receiving order workflows
- Validate stock level updates
- Practice return processing scenarios

## Staging-Specific Features

### Controlled Environment
- No real shipments or financial transactions
- Safe testing of error scenarios
- Ability to reset data when needed

### Extended Testing Support
For complex testing scenarios, contact your onboarding representative to:

- **Configure specific test data** for your use cases
- **Simulate warehouse operations** like receiving and shipping
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Validate status transitions** for orders and inventory

### Data Management
- Test data can be reset as needed
- Multiple test scenarios can run simultaneously
- Historical test data is maintained for debugging

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can I test in the staging environment?">
    You can test all API functionality including product creation, order processing, receiving orders, returns, and status monitoring. All operations work exactly like production but with test data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get test inventory for orders?">
    Contact your onboarding representative to set up test inventory for your product definitions. This allows you to test complete order workflows including stock validation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I test order status transitions?">
    Yes, your onboarding representative can help simulate status transitions for orders and receiving orders to test your status monitoring and webhook integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many test orders should I create?">
    We recommend creating at least 3-5 test orders with different configurations to thoroughly test your integration and error handling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is staging data isolated from production?">
    Yes, staging and production environments are completely separate. No staging data affects production operations, and vice versa.
